# PAGE_HSE_PROJECT
This repository contains code for a book-marking web application that utilises the Django framework and of course, python. 
The web application additionally incorporates Javascript, JQuery and Ajax. 
The result can be seen and explored via this link where I have deployed the project: https://frankolum.pythonanywhere.com
